## Weekly Cadence & Time Estimates

### Phase 1 (Completed): 15 hours total
- Repository analysis: 3 hours
- Data modeling & indexing: 5 hours
- Automation scripts: 4 hours
- CLI & documentation: 3 hours

### Phase 2-4 (Planned): 10-12 hours/week
- **Daily commitment**: 1.5-2 hours
- **Weekend deep-dives**: 3-4 hours
- **Review sessions**: 2-3 times/week
- **Progress tracking**: Weekly milestone reviews

## Success Metrics & Validation

### Technical Metrics
- **Code Quality**: All scripts pass lint/type checking
- **Coverage Goals**: Maintain 90%+ problem coverage
- **Performance**: Index rebuilds complete in <30 seconds
- **Reliability**: Zero-error daily plan generation

### Learning Metrics
- **Problem Solving**: 2-3 new problems daily
- **Review Cadence**: 30% time on spaced repetition
- **Topic Mastery**: Complete understanding before progression
- **Interview Readiness**: Mock scenarios weekly in later phases

## Risk Mitigation & Contingencies

### Identified Risks
1. **Coverage Gaps**: 154 Python implementations missing
2. **Time Management**: Balancing new topics vs review
3. **Technical Debt**: Manual mapping for complex problems

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Prioritized Implementation**: Focus on high-impact missing problems
2. **Automated Scheduling**: Spaced repetition prevents cramming
3. **Incremental Improvement**: 5% coverage increase per week target

## Resource Management

### Infrastructure
- **Environment**: uv-managed Python 3.11+ virtual environment
- **Dependencies**: Rich/Typer for CLI, Pydantic for data validation
- **Storage**: JSONL for efficient data interchange
- **Version Control**: Git with atomic commits per milestone
