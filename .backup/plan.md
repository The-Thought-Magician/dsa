## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment with uv
2. Create learning application architecture
3. Begin with DSA foundations and patterns
4. Track progress through done.md updates
5. Generate problem_mappings.json (scripts/build_problem_mappings.py) and review unmatched set
6. Fill high-yield unmatched gaps (Arrays, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Graph, DP)
7. Integrate additional-content.md resources per pattern into resources manifest (deferred)

Accelerated DSA Cycle (Repeating Weekly Focus)
- Day 1: Arrays + Two Pointers + Sliding Window drill set (mix easy/medium)
- Day 2: Binary Search (on answer space) + Prefix/Hashing reinforcement
- Day 3: Recursion to Backtracking transition + Bit tricks
- Day 4: Trees/BST core traversals + pattern variations
- Day 5: Graph BFS/DFS + shortest paths intro + Union Find
- Day 6: Dynamic Programming pattern rotation (1D, subseq, grid)
- Day 7: Mixed mock (8 problems: 2 array, 1 graph, 2 dp, 1 tree, 1 string, 1 wildcard) + review

Mapping Reference
- Mapping file: data/problem_mappings.json
- Use match_status filters: matched, python_only, unmatched
- Prioritization rule: unmatched in core patterns first, then python_only needing C++ reference alignment if conceptual gap.

Future Phase Outline
- System Design: produce manifest of core components, case studies, practice prompts
- ML/DL: staged curriculum (math foundations → classical ML → NN → transformers → LLM ops)
- Frontend: JS/TS core mastery checklist, React hooks + patterns, performance & accessibility
